[00:04.13] Wait a second, let me catch my breath
[00:09.35] Remind me how it feels to hear your voice
[00:14.74] Your lips are movin', I can't hear a thing
[00:20.58] Livin' life as if we had a choice
[00:37.08] 
[00:26.33] Anywhere, anytime
[00:28.82] I would do anything for you
[00:34.24] Anything for ya
[00:41.74] 
[00:36.80] Yesterday got away
[00:39.69] Melodies stuck inside your head
[00:44.77] A song in every breath
[00:55.77] 
[00:47.72] Sing me to sleep now
[00:52.83] Sing me to sleep
[00:57.92] Oh, won't you sing me to sleep now?
[01:03.71] Sing me to sleep
[01:11.71] 
[01:31.29] Remember me now, time cannot erase
[01:36.91] I can hear your whispers in my mind
[01:42.33] I've become what you cannot embrace
[01:47.57] Our memory will be my lullaby
[02:02.07] 
[01:53.15] Sing me to sleep now
[01:58.22] Sing me to sleep
[02:03.32] Oh, won't you sing me to sleep now?
[02:09.28] Sing me to sleep
[02:17.28] 
[02:37.59] Any-anytime
[02:39.60] I would do-do-do-do-do
[02:43.03] Time away
[02:45.16] Yesterday-day-day-day
[02:55.66] 
[02:47.86] Any-anytime
[02:50.69] I would do-do-do-do-do
[02:54.02] Time away
[02:56.08] Yesterday-day-day-day
